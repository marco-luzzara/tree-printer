# Tree Printer

I made this tree printer because a [Stack Overflow user asked for this kind of utility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71078629/visualize-binary-tree-in-bash-terminal). It is far from perfect and probably full of bugs, so feel free to open an issue or comment directly under my answer on SO if you have some good advice.

You can find an example of its usage in `tester.py`.
